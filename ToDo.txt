to do in code:
1. use writeline in x and y; only do write and writeline in xy
2. address spooling of arduino serial data. Enforce controlled file write
3. write only specific section of arduino output x for x, y for y and so on
4. write functions to clean up x and make code reusable
5. replicate x to y and xy
6. replicate xto roll, pitch, yaw, rp, rw, py,rpy
7. Try include boundary conditions for test so random data do not go outside stage range (700x700mm) using AdVal
8. Write handler for when arduino is not connected
